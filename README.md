fractals
========

Fractal generation software

Eventually will support generating fractals like the Mandlebrot set. Currently supports a complex number class. Unit tested with the Catch framework (to run the tests, download the catch header file, put it in your path, make a build directory, and "make test." To just compile the complex number class as an object file, type make (the default creates complexn.o). Built (and all tests pass) on Mavericks 10.9 with Clang 5.0.
